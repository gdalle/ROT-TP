To run it, you need to:

1. Download this repository
2. Install the latest stable version of Julia
3. Open a Julia REPL
4. Install Pluto with the command `using Pkg; Pkg.add("Pluto")`
5. Launch a Pluto server with the command `using Pluto; Pluto.run()`
6. Find the file named `wardrop.jl` and click on it
7. Wait for the notebook to initialize

If you are not familiar with Julia, check out [this page](https://gdalle.github.io/IntroJulia/) first. In particular, the [tutorial](https://gdalle.github.io/IntroJulia/basics.html) on the basics of Julia and Pluto may be useful.
